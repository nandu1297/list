    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for
    documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content
    and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a
    programming language. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
    or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
    included cues for its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of
    HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
    interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a
    means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
    text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
    such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
    surround and provide information about document text and may include
    sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
    interpret the content of the page.
