    Structured Query Language (SQL) (pronounced /ˌɛsˌkjuˈɛl/ S-Q-L; or
    alternatively as /ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel") [4][5] is a domain-specific language
    used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system
    (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data
    incorporating relations among entities and variables. Introduced in the
    1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as
    ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records
    with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to
    reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.
